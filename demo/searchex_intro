# Searchex Repos can be shared on GitHub.
# See an example Repo at http://github.com/elixir-search/sample
# Repos can be downloaded to your local host.
# Searchex Repos can contain one or more collections.
# Each collection is defined by a 'config file':
searchex cat genesis
# Config files define doc paths, separators and meta-data fields.
# You can query a collection:
searchex query genesis 'adam eve'
# You can view results:
searchex show genesis 0
# Searchex has a CLI and an API.
# Searchex can be embedded in another Elixir project.
# Searchex is ready for testing but not for production.
# See http://searchex.org for more info.  :-)
